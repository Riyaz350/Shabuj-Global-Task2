# React Project Setup Guide

Welcome to the React Project! This guide will help you set up the project on your local machine. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:
1. **Git**: This is a version control system. You can download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. **Node.js**: This is a JavaScript runtime that includes `npm` (Node Package Manager). You can download and install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

1. Open your web browser and go to the GitHub repository page for the project.
2. Click the green "Code" button.
3. Copy the URL that appears. It should look something like this: `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git`.

Now, follow these steps to clone the repository to your computer:

1. Open **Git Bash** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux).
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    ```
    Replace `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git` with the URL you copied.

3. After the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd repository-name
    ```
    Replace `repository-name` with the actual name of the repository.

### 2. Install Project Dependencies

Dependencies are the libraries and tools that the project needs to work. Follow these steps to install them:

1. Make sure you are inside the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

This command will read the `package.json` file in the project and install all the required packages.

### 3. Start the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, you can start the project. This will run the project on your local machine so you can see it in your web browser.

1. In your terminal, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. After a few moments, you should see output indicating that the project is running. Usually, it will automatically open a new browser window or tab with the address `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. You're All Set!

You should now see the React project running in your browser. Congratulations!
